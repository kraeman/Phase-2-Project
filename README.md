# Sinatra-Project-Phase-2
My Sinatra project. Allows users create a profile that dynamically sets age based on birthdate and create cake recipes to store for later use and potential editing.

Install Instructions: Download from https://github.com/kraeman/Phase-2-Project. Install gems with bundler and run withcommand 'shotgun'. Open browser and go to localhost:9393 (9393 is default port on my computer, may be different for you)

Usage: Sign up or log in with username and password if already have an account. From the user's profile page, the user can edit the profile or go to see all of their cakes. From the user's cake index, you can view an individual cake in order to edit it.
